# Purpose
After struggling a lot in setting up a Simple React Socket App. I have built a Simple Counter app which is  

1.  Free from weird `cors` errors.
2.  Single Instance of socket using React Context Api.
3.  Handling consecutive node app crashes as Socket wants to use previous connections.

### Go ahead 

1. `npm install` in both  the directories `/` , `/client`.
2. `npm start` in both  the directories `/` , `/client`.
3.  Keep looking up the counter ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€.
